Ass1 - HTML - CSS



* What did you like about this project?

I was amazed when I saw that I could make a static website by running what I learned about the Web Development Fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Let me feel the charm of programming every little code.




* What did you struggle with in this project?

It takes me a long time to make this webpage, and the responsive web design part is not ideal. For some desired designs, I can't immediately think of the corresponding codes to realise.




* What would make your experience with this assessment better?


I later completed the project again. The time is reduced by nearly half, and the responsive web design is also more proficient. Constant practice can improve my understanding and completion of this project.
