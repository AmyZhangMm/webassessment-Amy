What did you like about this project?

- I think its course content arrangement is very practical. It allows us to understand and be familiar with and use the work content of this position as quickly as possible.

What did you struggle with in this project?

- Because of the compression of the course, I feel that I cannot fully absorb the content I learn every day. (I am not a fast learner, especially in the IT industry that I have never been exposed to and non-native English speaker, some important content will be missed.) I will review it after class, but I need to keep up with the ew content progress as well. But I have been overcoming these difficulties.


What would make your experience with this assessment better?
- I hope the teachers can give me some advice on how they got through this transition period quickly. My own plan is to try to find exercises to keep impressing.
